# PrestigeModel

Both require Python 3

**PrestigeModelSimple.py**

Requires numpy and matplotlib as well. To recreate the results from the paper, try

python PrestigeModelSimple.py -q 0.5 --plot

python PrestigeModelSimple.py -q 0.53 --plot

python PrestigeModelSimple.py -q 0.54 --plot

**PrestigeModel.py**

For plotting graphs, this also needs graph-tool. https://graph-tool.skewed.de/
